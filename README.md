During my time as a data science student, I gained practical experience in various facets of the field, including data analysis, machine learning, hypothesis testing, and programming. I am proficient in Python and well-acquainted with popular libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, and SciPy. I'm also adept at using SQL for data manipulation and have experience with data visualization tools such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.

In addition to my data science background, I bring with me valuable experiences from my previous roles as an office manager and lead dental assistant. These positions have equipped me with a strong foundation in crucial skills like organization, adaptability, time management, teamwork, and effective communication.

âš¡ Fun Facts: Outside of my professional pursuits, I enjoy activities such as climbing, hiking, and embracing the outdoors. However, there are times when I also appreciate being a homebody. One quirky detail about me is that I have an irrational fear of cats.</p><p align='left'> You can view my resume here:
