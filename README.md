As a data science student, I have gained hands-on experience in data analysis, machine learning, hypothesis tests, and programming. Proficient in Python, I am well-versed with popular libraries like Pandas, Numpy, and SciPy, along with SQL and data visualization tools such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.  

In addition, I have previous experiences as an office manager and a lead dental assistant. These roles have taught me a strong foundation in organization, adaptability, time management, teamwork, and communication. 

âš¡ Fun Facts: I like to go climb, hike, and enjoy the outdoor. However, I can be a homebody at times.</p><p align='left'> You can view my resume <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vR8ICAYDvDS6mhumMDh8KU-1_xsEvQIBBqv1vZfnfZs/edit ' target=_blank><u>here</u>.</a></p>
